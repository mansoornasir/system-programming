    A process in running state means that it is running or itâ€™s ready to run.
    The process is in a sleeping state when it is waiting for a resource to be available.
    A process in Interruptible sleep will wakeup to handle signals, whereas a process in Uninterruptible sleep will not.
    A process enters a stopped state when it receives a stop signal.
    Zombie state is when a process is dead but the entry for the process is still present in the table.
